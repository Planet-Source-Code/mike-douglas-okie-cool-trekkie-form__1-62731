### Description

Makes a "Trekkie" looking form by simply dropping the control on the form. Very light-weight, not a ton of features, but a very nice effect. There are two versions, one is a form that has all the code written into it, the other is a form utilizing the cool form control as an example of how much cleaner a project is when things like this are compartmentalized.
